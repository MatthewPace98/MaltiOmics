# MaltiOmics
Welcome to the repo for my text-only, ASCII-wave website. Its partly an online resume, but mostly just a fun little project where I messed around with web development and javascript animations. Check it out at https://MaltiOmics.com! 

### The name
This may go over people's head unless the person is also a Maltese analyst of biological data. It is a pun for _Multi_-omics which is the analysis of multiple "-omes" (the genome, proteome, transcriptome), i.e., analysis of multiple aspects of a living organism. "Malti", as you may have guessed, means "Maltese" in my native language.

### Resources used
The interactive 3D DNA model was made possible by adapting code from Andrew Sink's brilliant script which ASCIIfies STL files:

And by using the DNA STL file made publically available by Jacob Robinson:

I've also made use of bootstrap for better organisation, and FireBase for hosting.
