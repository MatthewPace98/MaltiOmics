# MaltiOmics
Welcome to the repo for my text-only, ASCII-wave website. Check it out at https://MaltiOmics.com! 

### The name
This may go over people's head unless the person is also a Maltese analyst of biological data. It is a pun for _Multi_-omics which is the analysis of multiple "-omes" (the genome, proteome, transcriptome), i.e., analysis of multiple aspects of a living organism. "Malti", as you may have guessed, means "Maltese" in my native language.

### Resources used
The interactive 3D DNA model was made possible by scraping code from Andrew Sink's brilliant [STL-to-ASCII generator](https://andrewsink.github.io/STL-to-ASCII-Generator/)
in combination with the [DNA STL file](https://3d.nih.gov/entries/3DPX-003919) made public by Jacob Robinson.  I've also made use of Bootstrap 5 for better \<div\> organisation, and FireBase for hosting.
