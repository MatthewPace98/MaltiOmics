Of note, not all columns will be present in all output files.
Some columns are specific to particular perturbation modes.

"Gene": gene token
"Gene_name": gene name
"Ensembl_ID": gene Ensembl ID
"N_Detections": number of cells in which each gene or gene combination was detected in the input dataset

"Shift_to_goal_end": cosine shift from start state towards goal end state in response to given perturbation
"Shift_to_alt_end": cosine shift from start state towards alternate end state in response to given perturbation
"Goal_end_vs_random_pval": pvalue of cosine shift from start state towards goal end state by Wilcoxon
    pvalue compares shift caused by perturbing given gene compared to random genes
"Alt_end_vs_random_pval": pvalue of cosine shift from start state towards alternate end state by Wilcoxon
    pvalue compares shift caused by perturbing given gene compared to random genes
"Goal_end_FDR": Benjamini-Hochberg correction of "Goal_end_vs_random_pval"
"Alt_end_FDR": Benjamini-Hochberg correction of "Alt_end_vs_random_pval"

"Test_avg_shift": cosine shift in response to given perturbation in cells from test distribution
"Null_avg_shift": cosine shift in response to given perturbation in cells from null distribution (e.g. random cells)
"Test_vs_null_avg_shift": difference in cosine shift in cells from test vs. null distribution
    (i.e. "Test_avg_shift" minus "Null_avg_shift")
"Test_vs_null_pval": pvalue of cosine shift in test vs. null distribution
"Test_vs_null_FDR": Benjamini-Hochberg correction of "Test_vs_null_pval"
"N_Detections_test": "N_Detections" in cells from test distribution
"N_Detections_null": "N_Detections" in cells from null distribution

"Anchor_shift": cosine shift in response to given perturbation of anchor gene
"Test_token_shift": cosine shift in response to given perturbation of test gene
"Sum_of_indiv_shifts": sum of cosine shifts in response to individually perturbing test and anchor genes
"Combo_shift": cosine shift in response to given perturbation of both anchor and test gene(s) in combination
"Combo_minus_sum_shift": difference of cosine shifts in response combo perturbation vs. sum of individual perturbations
    (i.e. "Combo_shift" minus "Sum_of_indiv_shifts")
"Impact_component": whether the given perturbation was modeled to be within the impact component by the mixture model
    1: within impact component; 0: not within impact component
"Impact_component_percent": percent of cells in which given perturbation was modeled to be within impact component
